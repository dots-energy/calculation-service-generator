# 'DOTS service-generator' Service description
#
# for all 'key: value' pairs: no spaces, no capitals (snake_case)
# most values can be (should be) changed by the user as if indicated as 'IMMUTABLE'
# some key names can be changed as well except when not indicated as 'IMMUTABLE'
#
# 'variables' sections (service_config, new_step_data, calculations input/output data)
#     consist of 0 or more items: 'variable_name: variable_type'
# supported variable types are:  'int', 'float', 'str', 'bool', 'dict',
#                                'List[int]', 'List[float]', 'List[str]', 'List[bool]'
#
# The 'new_step_data' variables should be same for all services
# The 'calculations' output data names ('sends') should not contain duplicates
# The 'calculations' input names ('receives') may contain duplicates,
#     but the origin_service_name and variables have to be the same
